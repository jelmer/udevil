TRANSLATIONS

Translating udevil doesn't require any special tools - just a text editor.
To create a translation of udevil for your language, follow these steps.

1)  Install build dependencies, download the udevil source code tarball, and
    extract it (see README - BUILD).

2)  Open a terminal and enter the source code subdirectory 'po'

3)  Generate a udevil.pot file:

        intltool-update --pot

4)  Create a .po file for your language.  This example uses French (fr) -
    change 'fr' in the examples below to your language code:

        cp udevil.pot fr.po   # create a new po file

5)  Open fr.po in your text editor.  Complete the comments at the top - for
    example, change "FIRST AUTHOR <EMAIL@ADDRESS>, YEAR." to your name, email
    address, and the current year.  Be sure to set charset=UTF-8 in the
    Content-Type line.

6)  Translate each msgid into the corresponding msgstr.  (The program poedit
    has also been suggested as a convenient way to edit po files.)

7)  Open po/LINGUAS in your text editor and add a line for your language code.

8)  cd into the directory containing configure and run make normally:

        cd ..
        ./configure
        make

    If necessary, correct any syntax errors or warnings produced by make
    relating to your .po file and run make again.

9)  Test your translation by installing and running udevil:

        sudo make install
        udevil --help

    To start udevil with a particular locale:

        LANG=fr_FR.utf8 udevil --help

10) Once translations are the way you want them, release your translated .po
    file:

    If you are familiar with github, you can clone the udevil repo and do a
    pull request.  https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

    OR, add the .po file to a public gist https://gist.github.com/ or host
    it elsewhere, then open a new issue asking for your file to be merged into
    the source:  https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/udevil/issues/new

    OR, email your .po file:  http://igurublog.wordpress.com/contact-ignorantguru/

11) Translated strings will change occassionally as new udevil versions are
    released.  To update your translation:

    Generate a udevil.pot file:

        intltool-update --pot

    Then merge the new strings with the already translated ones:

        intltool-update --dist fr

    OR, if you donâ€™t want to overwrite fr.po initially, you can merge into a
    new test file:

        intltool-update --dist --output-file=fr-test.po fr

    Then complete any missing or fuzzy translations in the .po file, and repeat
    steps 8 through 10.
